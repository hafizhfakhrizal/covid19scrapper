# covid19scrapper
This repository aims to provide database on daily COVID-19 cases in 514 districts within 34 provinces in Indonesia. The data we aim to gather are number of positive cases, recovered cases, death cases, and suspect cases of COVID-19 in each district in Indonesia. These data are available in each provinces’ dedicated COVID-19 web pages. However,  the data structure in each provinces’ website varies, where some provide tables that can be scraped automatically, tables that has to be manually inputted/copied, data in the form of image (jpg/png/pdf), and spatial data (map-based dataset).
